#matrix_operation
(A + B) * (C + D)

The goal of project is to make (A+B)*(C+D) matrix operation using OOP concepts.
The project consists of three parts.

The first part generates four matrix files with user defined parameters(matrix quantity in file, matrix rows and columns limits). The matrices in file consist of random generated integer elements from the interval [-99, 99].
The second part as an input takes four files, and as a result generates a result.txt, that contains results of the operation mentioned above.
The third part is testing. In this phase a comparative analysis of golden_out.txt and result.txt files is provided.
